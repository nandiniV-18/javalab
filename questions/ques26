 * 2) A HighSchool application has two classes: the Person superclass and the Student subclass. 
 * Using inheritance, you will create two new classes, Teacher and CollegeStudent. 
 * A Teacher will be like Person but will have additional properties such as salary 
 * (the amount the teacher earns) and subject (e.g. “Computer Science”, “Chemistry”,
 * “English”, “Other”). The CollegeStudent class will extend the Student class by adding 
 * a year (current level in college) and major (e.g. “Electrical Engineering”, “Communications”, “Undeclared”)
